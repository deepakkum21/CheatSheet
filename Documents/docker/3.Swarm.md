# Swarm

## Understanding Swarm clusters
1. A swarm is a **group of machines that are running Docker and joined into a cluster**.
2. After that has happened, you continue to run the Docker commands you’re used to, but **now they are executed on a cluster by a swarm manager**. 
3. The machines in a swarm can be physical or virtual. 
4. **After joining a swarm, they are referred to as nodes**.
5. **Swarm Strategies**
    - Swarm managers can use several strategies to run containers, such as “**emptiest node**” -- **which fills the least utilized machines with containers**.
    - “**global**”, which ensures that **each machine gets exactly one instance of the specified container**. 
    - You instruct the swarm manager to use these strategies in the Compose file, just like the one you have already been using.
6. **Swarm managers are the only machines in a swarm that can execute your commands, or authorize other machines to join the swarm as workers**. 
7. **Workers are just there to provide capacity and do not have the authority to tell any other machine what it can and cannot do**.
8. Up until now, you have been using Docker in a single-host mode on your local machine. 
    - But Docker also can be switched into swarm mode, and that’s what enables the use of swarms. 
    - Enabling swarm mode instantly makes the current machine a swarm manager. 
    - From then on, Docker runs the commands you execute on the swarm you’re managing, rather than just on the current machine.

## Set up your swarm
1. A swarm is made up of multiple nodes, which can be either physical or virtual machines. 
2. The basic concept is simple enough: run `docker swarm init` to **enable swarm mode and make your current machine a swarm manager**.
3. Then run `docker swarm join` on **other machines to have them join the swarm as workers**. Choose a tab below to see how this plays out in various contexts. We use VMs to quickly create a two-machine cluster and turn it into a swarm.

## Create a cluster
- **create a couple of VMs using docker-machine, using the VirtualBox driver:**
`docker-machine create --driver virtualbox myvm1`
`docker-machine create --driver virtualbox myvm2`

## LIST THE VMS AND GET THEIR IP ADDRESSES
`docker-machine ls`

## INITIALIZE THE SWARM AND ADD NODES
- The **first machine acts as the manager**, which executes management commands and authenticates workers to join the swarm, and the **second is a worker**.
- can send commands to your VMs using `docker-machine ssh`. Instruct myvm1 to become a swarm manager with docker swarm init and look for output like this
- `docker swarm init --advertise-addr <myvm1 ip>` if vm machine or `docker swarm init --advertise-addr $(docker-machine ip)` 
- `docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker swarm init --advertise-addr <myvm1 ip>"`
                Swarm initialized: current node <node ID> is now a manager.

                To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

                docker swarm join \
                --token <token> \
                <myvm ip>:<port>

                To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions. 

## Making the nodes join the swarm manager
- the response to docker swarm init contains a pre-configured docker swarm join command for you to run on any nodes you want to add. Copy this command, and send it to **myvm2 via docker-machine ssh to have myvm2 join your new swarm as a worker**:
- `docker-machine ssh myvm1 docker swarm join --token <token> <swarm manager ip>:<port>`
- eg `docker-machine ssh myvm1 docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-1dcawmec7xfveex5l7tgnvrfkxbuhyfg497vw7wx252cacfwrj-blbs56tpx4x8t4hd2cf5quwmz 192.168.99.100:2377`

## LIST THE VMS AND GET THEIR IP ADDRESSES 
`docker node ls`

## to view the nodes in this swarm (on manager)
`docker-machine ssh default "docker node ls"`


## Create a VM (Mac, Win7, Linux)
`docker-machine create --driver virtualbox myvm1` 

## Win10
`docker-machine create -d hyperv --hyperv-virtual-switch "myswitch" myvm1` 

## View basic information about your node
`docker-machine env vm_name` or  `docker-machine env default`               

## List the nodes in your swarm
`docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker node ls" ` or `docker-machine ssh default "docker node ls" `       

## Inspect a node
`docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker node inspect <node ID>"`       

## View join token
`docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker swarm join-token -q worker"`  

## Open an SSH session with the VM; type "exit" to end
`docker-machine ssh myvm1`   

## View nodes in swarm (while logged on to manager)
`docker node ls `               

## Make the worker leave the swarm
`docker-machine ssh myvm2 "docker swarm leave"` 

## Make master leave, kill swarm
`docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker swarm leave -f"` 

## list VMs, asterisk shows which VM this shell is talking to
`docker-machine ls` 

## Start a VM that is currently not running
`docker-machine start myvm1`            

## show environment variables and command for myvm1
`docker-machine env myvm1`      

## Mac command to connect shell to myvm1
`eval $(docker-machine env myvm1)`         

## Windows command to connect shell to myvm1
`& "C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\Resources\bin\docker-machine.exe" env myvm1 | Invoke-Expression`   

## Deploy an app; command shell must be set to talk to manager (myvm1), uses local Compose file
`docker stack deploy -c <file> <app>`  

## Copy file to node's home dir (only required if you use ssh to connect to manager and deploy the app)
`docker-machine scp docker-compose.yml myvm1:~ `

## Deploy an app using ssh (you must have first copied the Compose file to myvm1)
`docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker stack deploy -c <file> <app>" `  

## Disconnect shell from VMs, use native docker
`eval $(docker-machine env -u)`     

## Stop all running VMs
`docker-machine stop $(docker-machine ls -q)`               

## Delete all VMs and their disk images
`docker-machine rm $(docker-machine ls -q)`
